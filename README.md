# Netflix Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Netflix movies and TV shows using Python, SQL, Excel, and Machine Learning.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Excel (Pivot Tables, Dashboard)
- Machine Learning (KMeans Clustering)

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and feature engineering using Python
2. SQL-based validation and analysis
3. Excel dashboard creation with KPIs and charts
4. Machine Learning using unsupervised clustering

## Key Insights
- Movies dominate Netflix content
- Content growth increased after 2016
- United States and India are top content producers
- TV-MA is the most common rating

## Machine Learning
Used KMeans clustering to segment Netflix content based on type, rating, and release timeline.
